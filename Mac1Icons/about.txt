Hey.

It's me again.

You know, the guy who made that Mac1 GTK2 Theme?

Yeah, that guy.

To complement the GTK2 theme, I made an icon theme to go along with it.


The icons currently come in 2 sizes, 16x16, and 32x32.

The 16 icons are mainly for the tiny menus.

The 32 icons are mainly for normal viewing.

All the others are just extras I made for the fun of it.

--EDIT: The icons now come in many more sizes; all the 32 to 256 icons are okay for use!


The icon theme is comprised of 3 different varients:

The first ones are the icons that I made from scratch (e.g., the Firefox icon)

The 1.5th ones are the icons that are just cropped from images, but have been edited slightly.

The second are the icons that I cropped from images of the internet (or what I could find)

The third are just refurbished Elementary-XFCE (default Xubuntu icons) icons


Oh, and by the way, some icons (and by some I literally mean 8 icons) are monochromed versions of the NineIcons theme, which served as the base for this theme.

To install, just shove this folder in the .icons folder.
